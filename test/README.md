FizzBuzz

Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions.
For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and
not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are
divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those)


ChessBoard

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using new-line characters to
separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a # character. The characters
should form a chessboard.
Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
